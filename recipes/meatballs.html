    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy Meatball Recipe is tender, juicy and flavorful! Bake them, fry them, or slow cook — they work with any sauce you enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices soft bread (about 120 grams or 1.5 cups fresh. fluffed bread crumbs)
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup water
        </li>
        <li> lb ground beef
        </li>
        <li>1 lb ground pork
        </li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (fresh if possible)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F and line a baking sheet with tin foil — optional but helps with clean up!
        </li>
        <li>Tear bread into small pieces and place in a food processor (a blender may work). Process until the bread is in fine crumbs and combine with water. Stir and let sit for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine beef, pork, cheese, eggs, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and soaked bread until just combined — don't overmix!
        </li>
        <li>Shape into 1.5-2" balls (I get about 40 this way, but you can get up to 60 if you shape them into 1" balls) and place 1" apart on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes (longer for 2" rounds, shorter for 1" rounds), until a meat thermometer reads at least 160 degrees F in the largest meatballs (a meat thermometer is your best chance at having perfectly cooked meatballs!)
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Add to your favorite sauce, or let cool for 20-30 minutes before placing in a freezer safe bag or container and storing in the fridge or freezer.</li>
    </ol>
